# Born2beRoot: Project Overview
As part of my 42 journey, I am creating my first Virtual Machine (VM). Since this project does not produce source code or traditional archives to add to my portfolio, I have chosen to develop comprehensive documentation. This guide is intended to serve both as a personal reference and as a resource for others who are embarking on similar VM setup tasks, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and lessons learned throughout the process.

>[!CAUTION]
>Since this project serves as an introduction to virtualisation, I will focus on installing the minimum of services. For this reason, **I will not provide sources concerning the graphical interface**.

# Born2beRoot: Project Features
>[!CAUTION]
>Keep in mind this documentation concerns the creation of a **minimalist** VM. I am going to discuss **exclusively** the implementation of the **essential elements**. I am NOT going to address the implementation of UI or other additional features.
