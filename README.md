# About Born2beRoot
As part of my 42 journey, I am creating my first Virtual Machine (VM). Since this project does not produce source code or traditional archives to add to my portfolio, I have chosen to develop comprehensive documentation. This guide is intended to serve both as a personal reference and as a resource for others who are embarking on similar VM setup tasks, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and lessons learned throughout the process.

>[!CAUTION]
>Since this project serves as an introduction to virtualisation, I will focus on installing the minimum of services. For this reason, I will not provide a graphical interface.
