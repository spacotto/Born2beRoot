# About Born2beRoot
As part of my 42 journey, I am creating my first Virtual Machine (VM). Since this project does not produce source code or traditional archives to add to my portfolio, I have chosen to develop comprehensive documentation. This guide is intended to serve both as a personal reference and as a resource for others who are embarking on similar VM setup tasks, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and lessons learned throughout the process.

# Introduction
**Note:** This section is a work in progress and will be updated soon.

>[!CAUTION]
>Since this project serves as an introduction to virtualisation, I will focus on installing the minimum of services. For this reason, **I will not provide a graphical interface**.

## Why VirtualBox?
**VirtualBox** is an excellent choice for creating your **first VM** because it is **free**, **open-source**, and **works on all major operating systems**, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Its **user-friendly interface** makes setup straightforward, even for those with no prior experience in virtualisation. VirtualBox also offers a wide range of **features**, supports **many guest operating systems**, and has an **active community** that provides helpful **documentation** and troubleshooting support.

## Downloading and Installing VirtualBox
**Note:** This section is a work in progress and will be updated soon.

## Operating System: Debian 13 (Trixie)
I chose **Debian 13 (Trixie)** over Rocky Linux because, as a beginner, I wanted a system that is simple to set up, well-documented, and widely supported by the community. Debian is known for its stability and ease of use, making it ideal for learning the basics of Linux without being overwhelmed by complexity. 

Moreover, since **I'm not specifically interested in working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** environments or their derivatives, Rocky Linux's enterprise focus didn't match my needs. Debian 13 lets me explore, learn, and customise my VM with confidence, while providing plenty of helpful resources for newcomers.
