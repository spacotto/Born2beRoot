# About Born2beRoot
As part of my 42 journey, I am creating my first Virtual Machine (VM). Since this project does not produce source code or traditional archives to add to my portfolio, I have chosen to develop comprehensive documentation. This guide is intended to serve both as a personal reference and as a resource for others who are embarking on similar VM setup tasks, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and lessons learned throughout the process.

# Guide: How to set up a Virtual Machine (VM)
>[!CAUTION]
>Since this project serves as an introduction to virtualisation, I will focus on installing the minimum of services. For this reason, **I will not provide a graphical interface**.

## Virtualisation Software: VirtualBox
**VirtualBox** is an excellent choice for creating your **first VM** because it is **free**, **open-source**, and **works on all major operating systems**, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

Its **user-friendly interface** makes setup straightforward, even for those with no prior experience in virtualisation. 

VirtualBox also offers a wide range of **features**, supports **many guest operating systems**, and has an **active community** that provides helpful **documentation** and troubleshooting support.

## Operating System: Debian 13 (Trixie)
