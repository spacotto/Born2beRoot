# About Born2beRoot
As part of my 42 journey, I am creating my first Virtual Machine (VM). Since this project does not produce source code or traditional archives to add to my portfolio, I have chosen to develop comprehensive documentation. This guide is intended to serve both as a personal reference and as a resource for others who are embarking on similar VM setup tasks, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and lessons learned throughout the process.

>[!CAUTION]
>Since this project serves as an introduction to virtualisation, I will focus on installing the minimum of services. For this reason, **I will not provide sources concerning the graphical interface**.

## Virtualisation Software (Hypervisor)
- **Software:** VirtualBox
- **Version:** 

>[!NOTE]

## Features
>[!CAUTION]
>Keep in mind that this is a guide to creating a **basic** VM. I am going to discuss **exclusively** the implementation of the essential, minimum elements. I am NOT going to address the implementation of UI or other additional features.

### Installation
>[!NOTE]
>Find out more about the VM installation [here](https://github.com/spacotto/Born2beRoot/blob/main/srcs/vm-installation.md).
