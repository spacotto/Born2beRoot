# VirtualBox (and UTM)
**VirtualBox** is a free, open-source virtualisation program that lets you run entire operating systems inside your current operating system. Think of it as a computer inside your computer.

## 🖥️ What it does
VirtualBox lets you create virtual machines (VMs). A VM behaves like a real computer, with:
- virtual CPU
- virtual RAM
- virtual disk
- virtual network

Inside that VM, without affecting your main system, you can install:
- Debian
- Rocky Linux
- Windows
- macOS (with restrictions)
- other OS

## 🎯 What people use VirtualBox for
- Testing operating systems safely
- Learning Linux without touching the real machine
- Running older software
- Isolating risky apps
- Hosting small lab environments
- Trying server setups before doing them on real hardware

## 🧩 Why it’s relevant to your server project
If you want to practice setting up Debian or Rocky before touching your real server, VirtualBox is perfect. You can:
- Install Debian in a VM
- Practice configuring Nginx, SSH, and firewalls
- Break things and reinstall quickly
- Get confident before deploying the real server
