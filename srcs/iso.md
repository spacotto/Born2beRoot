# About Optical Disc Image (ISO Image)
An ISO image is a **digital replica of the entire contents of an optical disc**, such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc, saved as a single file. It contains a **sector-by-sector copy** of the original disc, including all files, folders, directory structures, file system metadata (like the ISO 9660 or UDF file system), and boot code, making it an exact duplicate of the source disc.

>[!NOTE]
>The name "ISO" originates from the **ISO 9660 file system standard**, which was originally used for CD-ROM media, although the format is now also applied to data structured using the Universal Disk Format (UDF).

ISO images are typically used for archiving, backing up, sharing, or distributing large software packages, operating systems (like Linux distributions or Windows), or multimedia content.
 They are not compressed, meaning the file size is usually large, as they store all the data from the disc in its original binary format.
 The .iso file extension is standard for this format.

To use an ISO image, it is not opened like a regular file. Instead, it is either mounted as a virtual drive by the operating system, allowing applications to access its contents as if a physical disc were inserted, or it can be burned to a physical optical disc using disc-burning software.
 This process creates a new disc that is an exact copy of the original.
 Users can also extract individual files from an ISO image without burning it, which is useful for accessing specific data.
 The integrity of the image can be verified using checksums to ensure it hasn't been corrupted or tampered with.
