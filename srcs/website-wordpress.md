# About WordPress
WordPress is a free, open-source **Content Management System (CMS)** that powers over 40% of all websites. It allows you to create and manage websites without writing code, though developers can extend it extensively.

## Getting Started
### Installation
WordPress requires a web host with PHP and MySQL. Most hosts offer one-click installation through their control panel.

### Manual installation
1. Download WordPress from wordpress.org
2. Create a MySQL database
3. Upload files via FTP
4. Run the installation script at yoursite.com/wp-admin/install.php
5. Enter database details and create admin account

### Dashboard
Access the admin dashboard at `yoursite.com/wp-admin`. This is where you manage all content and settings.

## Core Concepts
### Posts vs Pages
**Posts** are timely content displayed in reverse chronological order (blog entries, news). They have categories and tags.

**Pages** are static content (About, Contact, Services). They exist outside the chronological flow and can be hierarchical.

**Themes**
Themes control your site's **appearance**. You can install free themes from the WordPress repository or purchase premium themes. Change themes at Appearance → Themes without losing content.

**Plugins**
Plugins add **functionality** to WordPress. Install from `Plugins → Add New`. Essential plugins often include SEO tools, security, backups, and contact forms.
