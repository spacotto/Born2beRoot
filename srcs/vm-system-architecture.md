# About System Architecture
This section is dedicated to the first part of the **installation process**. Herein, I am going to explain how to attach the ISO of the chosen Debian distros and configure locals, network, users, and passwords. You can find the second part of the installation (aka the configuration of the storage architecture) in its dedicated section.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before starting, you need to get the [ISO](https://github.com/spacotto/Born2beRoot/blob/main/srcs/iso.md). You can download the ISO [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/). I used the `debian-13.2.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso`. If you don't have much space, I recommend downloading it into the `tmp` folder.
