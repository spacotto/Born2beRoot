# About PHP
PHP is a server-side **scripting language** for web development. PHP code runs on the server and generates HTML sent to the browser.

## Basic Syntax
PHP code is enclosed in `<?php ?>` tags:
```
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```
Statements end with semicolons. 
Comments use `//` for single lines or `/* */` for multiple lines, like C.
