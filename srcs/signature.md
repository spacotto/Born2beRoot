# `signature.txt`
In most training or evaluation environments, `signature.txt` is a **file generated by your Virtual Machine (VM)** to prove that (1) the VM actually booted, (2) you are running the correct OS, and (3) the VM is uniquely yours (i.e., not copied from someone else). It’s basically a **machine-specific proof-of-execution**.

## Content
It is a text file (`.txt`) containing the **hash of your VM’s disk**. It’s a cryptographic **fingerprint** of your VM’s virtual disk.
