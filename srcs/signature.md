# `signature.txt`
In most training or evaluation environments, `signature.txt` is a **file generated by your Virtual Machine (VM)** to prove that (1) the VM actually booted, (2) you are running the correct OS, and (3) the VM is uniquely yours (i.e., not copied from someone else). It’s basically a **machine-specific proof-of-execution**.

## Content
It is a text file inside the VM containing:
- a hash or unique ID generated from the VM,
- the hostname,
- or the output of a command they asked you to run (e.g., `uname -a`).
