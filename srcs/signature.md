# `signature.txt`
In most training or evaluation environments, `signature.txt` is a **file generated by your Virtual Machine (VM)** to prove that (1) the VM actually booted, (2) you are running the correct OS, and (3) the VM is uniquely yours (i.e., not copied from someone else). It’s basically a **machine-specific proof-of-execution**.

## Content
It is a text file (`.txt`) containing the **hash of your VM’s disk**. It’s a cryptographic **fingerprint** of your VM’s virtual disk.

## Purpose
By hashing the disk, your corrector can verify that:
- you actually installed the OS (because your disk hash will be unique),
- the VM booted at least once (since many systems generate the hash after initial setup),
- you didn’t reuse someone else’s VM (each disk has different content, hence a different hash),
- no one modified the disk afterwards (if they re-hash the disk, it must match your signature file).
