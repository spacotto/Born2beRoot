# About Package Manager Configuration
>[!NOTE]
>Debian uses `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) and `dpkg` as its core package management systems. `apt` handles package installation, updates, and dependencies, while `dpkg` works at a lower level with individual `.deb` files.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>[Here](https://github.com/spacotto/Born2beRoot/blob/main/srcs/debian-apt-aptitude.md) you can find out more details about `apt` and `aptitude`.
