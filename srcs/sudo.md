# About `sudo`
>[!IMPORTANT]
>`sudo` is a **shell command** on Unix-like operating systems that **enables a user to run a program with the security privileges of another user**, by default the **superuser**.

>[!NOTE]
>It originally stood for `superuser do`, as that was all it did, and this remains its most common usage. However, the official **Sudo project page** lists it as `su 'do'`. The current Linux manual pages define `su` as `substitute user`, making the modern meaning of sudo `substitute user, do`, because `sudo` can **run a command as other users as well** (not only `root`).
