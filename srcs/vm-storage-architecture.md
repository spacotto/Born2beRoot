# About Storage Architecture
>[!WARNING]
>Despite being part of the [System Architecture](https://github.com/spacotto/Born2beRoot/blob/main/srcs/vm-system-architecture.md) (aka installation process), I have decided to dedicate to the Storage Architecture a separated file due to the amount of information concerning this matter.

>[!NOTE]
>[Here](https://github.com/spacotto/Born2beRoot/blob/main/srcs/vm-partitioning.md) you can find more details on what partitioning is.
