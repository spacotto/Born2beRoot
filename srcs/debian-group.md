# Create a User
Run the following command in the terminal and write the desired username instead of <username>:
```
sudo adduser <username>
```
For example:
```
sudo adduser spacotto
```
>[!TIP]
>If you want to make sure the user was successfully created, run the same command. If the user was created without issues, you will see the following error message:
>```
>fatal: The user `spacotto` already exists.
