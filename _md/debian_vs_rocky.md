# Debian vs. Rocky
**Debian** and **Rocky Linux** are free, open-source Linux distributions: complete operating systems that include the Linux kernel, system utilities, and thousands of pre-packaged software applications ready to install and use.

Both are community-driven projects focused on stability, security, and providing enterprise-grade server operating systems without licensing costs, making them popular choices for web servers, cloud infrastructure, and production environments.
